##  Project Title - Cats to QR codes 

## Description 

This project was conceived on paper, and moved to a MVP (minimum viable product) within one week. Week two was used to polish and add functionality to the application. It's basic purpose was to incorporate similtaneous use of two third party API systems. 

Features: 
It effectively translates the url of a jpg, png, or gif file into a readable QR code that the end user can scan and regenerate the original image. The user can also choose a particular breed of cat (if they have a favorite). Our application keeps a history of the last 10 images that the user looks up. 

Process hardships:
we need a visual representation of our build tree as an example of our commit process. 

Getting 

For future development:
If we had more time, we would like to have implemented the ability to do an AJAX POST, allowing a user to upload and retrieve pictures of their own cat.
